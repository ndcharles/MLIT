#### What I'm currently working on?
I am a graduate of Agricultural and Bioresources Engineering. Was once a classroom teacher (Grade 6) where I spent the COVID period using online platforms to teach the kids. No platform was able to truly satisfy my classroom experience. I am currently building **CommonEntranceHelp (CEH)** by hacking together WordPress theme, plugins and other low-code resources as a playground to nurture my interest in edtech.

Join me by donating to the project, helping with teaching resources or contributing your tech skill. 

You are highly appreciated when you do. 

Talk Soon!
