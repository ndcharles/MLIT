### Hai üëãüèª I am Ndcharles

<br/>
Ok. Hear me out.

I am knowledged about digital marketing, web platforms and tech in general which makes me a good growth hacker marketer. 

My engineering background and love for details led me to data science and analytics where I drill down data in search of meaning and hidden information. 

Speaking of eye for details, digital marketing and tech, as a product manager I spend time analysing web platforms to understand how they work and, how users use them in order to know how platforms should actually work best for its users.  

I currently work as a Data Analyst and also acting as a Product Manager. I often create email newsletters and online resources for our company's blog.

In my own time I am a homeschool teacher for Common Entrance pupils and every other things (albeit in tech). I design [WordPress websites](https://opendiari.com/thatbros), [write quick tech articles](https://opendiari.com), and read daily about tech and growth marketing.

All of my writings on [data science]({{site.baseurl}}/categories.html#data), [growth marketing]({{site.baseurl}}/categories.html#growth), [product marketing](#growth) and [tech_life]({{site.baseurl}}/categories.html#tech) can be found under the **Articles section**. My data science portfolio is at the **Portfolio section** (or just go [here](https://ndcharles.github.io/data_portfolio).) If you want to see all of the wonderful projects I‚Äôve worked on (and still working on), head over to the **Projects section**.

#### What I'm currently working on?
I am a graduate of Agricultural and Bioresources Engineering. Was once a classroom teacher (Grade 6) where I spent the COVID period using online platforms to teach the kids. No platform was able to truly satisfy my classroom experience. I am currently building **CommonEntranceHelp (CEH)** by hacking together WordPress theme, plugins and other low-code resources as a playground to nurture my interest in edtech.

Join me by donating to the project, helping with teaching resources or contributing your tech skill. 

You are highly appreciated when you do.
