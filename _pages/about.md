> During the COVID in 2020 I transitioned fully into tech as a Data Scientist. I have experience in digital marketing before now, so I easily focused on Analytics, with Growth and Product added to the pack (thanks to my first data role). I am interested in the real-life applications of data science and machine learning.

> Currently, at ALX, I work at the intersection of data analysis and operations (IT and community) and have built a few products. I work with Spreadsheets, Looker Studio, Tableau, Python, and SQL. I am currently learning and building more LLM-based products and software products to enhance team and community operations.

Ok. This next version is an extended version of me.

I am knowledged about digital marketing, web platforms and tech in general which gives me the ability to work across data, software and products. 

My engineering background and love for details led me to data science and analytics where I drill down data in search of meaning and hidden information. 

Speaking of eye for details, digital marketing and tech, as a product manager I spend time analysing web platforms to understand how they work and, how users use them in order to know how platforms should actually work best for its users. This knowledge also guides me while selecting and building tools for my team and community.

In my own time I used to be a homeschool teacher for Common Entrance pupils and every other things (albeit in tech). I design [WordPress websites](https://opendiari.com/thatbros), [write quick tech articles](https://opendiari.com), teach kids to code in Scratch, and read daily about tech and growth marketing. I am currently working on EdstreetNG, seeNaija and Stopeet.

#### What I'm currently working on?
I am a graduate of Agricultural and Bioresources Engineering. Was once a classroom teacher (Grade 6) where I spent the COVID period using online platforms to teach the kids. No platform was able to truly satisfy my classroom experience. I am currently building **CommonEntranceHelp (CEH)** by hacking together WordPress theme, plugins and other low-code resources as a playground to nurture my interest in edtech.

Join me by donating to the project, helping with teaching resources or contributing your tech skill. 

You are highly appreciated when you do.
