I build ML models (thanks to the abundance of frameworks from the likes of Scikit Learn, Google and Facebook prophet and more). I am currently doing a deep dive into more data science projects to improve my skillset and also get a fuller grasp of data engineering (AWS and ML in production). Ok. This next version is extended but hear me out. I am knowledged about digital marketing, web platforms and tech in general which makes me a good growth hacker marketer. My engineering background and love for details led me to data science and analytics where I drill down data in search of meaning and hidden information. Speaking of eye for details, digital marketing and tech, as a product manager I spend time analysing web platforms to understand how they work and, how users use them in order to know how platforms should actually work best for its users. I currently work as a Data Analyst and an acting Product Manager. I often create email newsletters and online resources for our company‚Äôs blog. In my own time I am a homeschool teacher for Common Entrance pupils and every other things (albeit in tech). I design WordPress websites, write quick tech articles, and read daily about tech and growth marketing. All of my writings on data science, growth marketing, product marketing and tech_life can be found under the Articles section.

    "body": "2019/01/24 - There are lots of powerful things you can do with the Markdown editor If you‚Äôve gotten pretty comfortable with writing in Markdown, then you may enjoy some more advanced tips about the types of things you can do with Markdown! As with the last post about the editor, you‚Äôll want to be actually editing this post as you read it so that you can see all the Markdown code we‚Äôre using. Special formatting: As well as bold and italics, you can also use some other special formatting in Markdown when the need arises, for example:  strike through ==highlight== *escaped characters*Writing code blocks: There are two types of code elements which can be inserted in Markdown, the first is inline, and the other is block. Inline code is formatted by wrapping any word or words in back-ticks, like this. Larger snippets of code can be displayed across multiple lines using triple back ticks: . my-link {  text-decoration: underline;}If you want to get really fancy, you can even add syntax highlighting using Rouge.  Reference lists: The quick brown jumped over the lazy. Another way to insert links in markdown is using reference lists. You might want to use this style of linking to cite reference material in a Wikipedia-style. All of the links are listed at the end of the document, so you can maintain full separation between content and its source or reference. Sample Blockquote:  Writing good technical articles is indeed a challenge, takes a lot of your personal time and often requires doing a lot of research. Of-course you should have a passion for reading and writing it. Before you write your paper, you need to understand your audience and your message. Full HTML: Perhaps the best part of Markdown is that you‚Äôre never limited to just Markdown. You can write HTML directly in the Markdown editor and it will just work as HTML usually does. No limits! Here‚Äôs a standard YouTube embed code as an example: "
