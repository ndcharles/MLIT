I got an email from InterviewQS on MSE vs RMSE and decided to read and then write about it.

> Explain what Mean Squared Error (MSE) and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) are. What are their similarities? What are their differences? When might you want to use one over the other?
> InterviewQS

Although the tag came as Mean Squared Error vs Root Mean Squared Error, there was an error where MSE was replaced with Mean Absolute Error (MAE). So, I will look at the 2 and a bit about MAE.
