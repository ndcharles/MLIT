The principles of checklists are applicable to most professions. Solutions to simple problems can quickly become complicated as we think through it. Using checklists can help in this situation to help bring us back to reality and also increases our chances of transferring our activities to others.

I came across [The Checklist Manifesto by Atul Gawande](https://atulgawande.com/book/the-checklist-manifesto/) and decided to take a deep dive, summarise it and get a guide on how to qucikly spin-up checklists.

## Key Questions
- Why do we fail at what we set out to do in the world?
- Can checklists help simplify complex processes?
- How can we be sure we have [almost] everything we need to solve a problem?
- How can we be sure we are applying this knowledge correctly?
- How easy is it for others to replicate our process?

Go here to get a recap and writing inspiration asides the book itself: https://jsilva.blog/2021/02/19/checklist-manifesto-summary/

Data Analysis Framework
The Data Analysis Framework focuses on a series of key questions that help us not only understand the problem at hand but also understand the data presented.  We will also focus on how to prepare our data to help us “Break it down” and gain insights later on.

Essentially, this framework is a set of logical and iterative steps that when followed appropriately support you in your data analysis. Let's dig in.
Step 1: Understand the Problem
Before even being able to solve any problem, you will need to understand what the problem is actually all about. Half of the solution can be found when the problem is understood. Luckily -- you already have the tools you need to be able to do this, such as:

- McKinsey Problem Statement Framework
- Cool Head, Warm Heart Model
- Problem Statements

Step 2: Identifying Relevant Data
After you have understood the problem fully, the next step is to think about the kind of data/information that you will need to solve the problem. This usually happens because you will receive a problem before you actually receive data regarding the problem. It then becomes your responsibility to decide which areas you will focus on. 

Step 3: Obtain the Data
Now that you know what the problem is, and what relevant data you need to collect, you can go into the process of actually obtaining the right data. At times you will be provided data, but more often than not either you or someone else will be expected to collect it from a number of sources.

Remember that just like any other bit of information in the world, data can be manipulated. So make sure that when obtaining data, you do so from a reliable source. We will learn more about how to tell whether a given dataset is legit or not.

Step 4: Clean the Data
One thing you will realize when working with data is that data does not always come clean. There are many factors leading to unclean data:

- The way the data was collected (e.g. the same survey questions being answered differently)
- The way that data is input:
	- Issues arising by a single person entering data in different formats
	- Issues arising from multiple people entering data in different formats

It is therefore very important, as people working with data, to clean the mess that exists. It is within the clean data that we are able to filter out useful insights that will help solve our problems.
