The principles of checklists are applicable to most professions. Solutions to simple problems can quickly become complicated as we think through it. Using checklists can help in this situation to help bring us back to reality and also increases our chances of transferring our activities to others.

I came across [The Checklist Manifesto by Atul Gawande](https://atulgawande.com/book/the-checklist-manifesto/) and decided to take a deep dive, summarise it and get a guide on how to qucikly spin-up checklists.

## Key Questions
- Why do we fail at what we set out to do in the world?
- Can checklists help simplify complex processes?
- How can we be sure we have [almost] everything we need to solve a problem?
- How can we be sure we are applying this knowledge correctly?
- How easy is it for others to replicate our process?

Go here to get a recap and writing inspiration asides the book itself: https://jsilva.blog/2021/02/19/checklist-manifesto-summary/
