I am never a picture person, it never comes out great, but for the sake of this piece, I took different pictures at different angles to know which woule come out fine.

We must have met somewhere; The ROOM townhalls (CTH), activation events, marketing outreach, application clinics, karibu or at the hub.

## Visualising data using datawrapper 
- Getting map data for custom graphing (https://hackernoon.com/how-to-convert-and-prepare-topojson-files-for-interactive-mapping-with-d3-499cf0ced5f)
- Get the data here: https://gadm.org/download_country.html (I used the GeoJSON file instead of shapefile. Selected only Lagos data. Uploaded the custom map to datawrapper.)

## People relations
Part of working here involved calling learners, fellows and others for one thing or another. Borrowing some learnings from ‘Better’ by Atul Gawande (a book about performance in medicine), there are several ways to make a positive difference especially when your work involves interacting with people.

- Be personable, learn to hold conversations, irrespective of the call scripts offered to you. Learn about the people you speak to. Listen and make note of what you learn. This is a big loophole I find in almost every customer relationship calls I have received. You're human not a robot, use that to your advantage.
- Don’t complain — It doesn’t solve anything but gets you down. Instead, in your conversation with others discuss ideas you read about, interesting problems you came across.
- Be observant - See everything as a learning phase and not problems. This also is one of the CHAIR values at ALX (Adventure).
- Write something — Writing helps you step back and think through a problem. With the degree of thoughtfulness that you put into writing you eventually become a better person.
- Explore change
