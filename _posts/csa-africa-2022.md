I attended [CSA Africa 2022](twitter.com/csa_africa), hosted by [So](twitter.com/) at [NitHub, UNILAG](twitter.com/nithub) and this is what I learnt.

T afirst, while I was applying and saw the option asking of your University, I thought I won't be selected (I'm already graduated). I filled it anyways and forgot about it until this...

There was lot of promises made to participants that I was so eager to attend. Free lunch, accomodation and three weeks of constant drills in python, data structures, machine learning and IoT. That sounds alot but the experience was worth it.

### Why was I there?

There is something I always believed about having enough information to get you ahead. And the need to connect with people going your way (on the same journey as you). CSA Africa was an avenue for me to explore programming beyond the confines of me and online tutorials. It was a means to learn and connect with people (beginners and experienced alike) in the tech space, meet amazing roomies I made friends out of and another I found a tech co-founder out of -- just kidding.

Well, I met people who were good at what they do. Those whom were in other walks of life but understand the use of programming in their future ambitions. I also met people who think far into the future and needed help grabbing that future by its horn.

### Further programming experience.

Our first day at CSAA was an awesomely scary experience that it made me question if I ever learnt to actually program in Python. Unfortunately not. I trained mostly using videos, textbooks and  Hi Stephen, twas wonderful having you speak of recursion and memonics. During our first class on recursion I recalled my very first task at work which involved a deeply nested json dictionary. I found it difficult untangling it and although a friend helped with some parts of it, I now realised recursion/memonics is best suited to such problems.

### The Machine Learning Experience


### Projects

I had a wonderful group. Although starting off was challenging, we found a way to kickoff and get the project going. We settled for a laptop price prediction project.

Given input characteristics: CPU, RAM,... we built a machine learning model to predict the price of a laptop.

The project isn't grandiose, but we learnt what we needed to while executing it. 

> We didn't change the world but we took a step further into changing the world.

Our team lead (@tife) stayed up till 1 am trying to perfect our PowerPoint presentation. He confessed learning a lot from that experience. Maradeben, was busy trying different models, even after we have saved our model, looking to improve our model from 89% accuracy score to 90-sth. He succeeded in getting to 98% (although we didn't end up using it due to technical constraints of his implementation). Omotayo was there trying to grasp the whole concept of ML (he will catch-up soon). And here I am, sharing the experience with you. I had exposure in ML, so I took it further to get the team to implement a FastAPI backend for our project.  

We created a FastAPI backend for our project, which we didn't project to everyone, but after the event I tried experimenting with streamlit for a frontend. The final laptop prediction project built with FastAPI and streamlit can be accessed here. 

You can read this follow-up article to know how we came up with data cleaning decisions for  our dataset and then creating a FastAPI backend and Streamlit frontend after the CSA Academy 2022 bootcamp.

I can go ahead and tell you about other groups, from implementing algorithms based on stable marriage (shock you ba?) to seeing the beginners class build amazing stuffs using Python and tkinter. 

### Overall Experience

In the end, if you ask me, "How was CSA Academy 2022 bootcamp?"
Ok. I should probably rephrase that question to the way Dr. Olumuyiwa puts it, "Minus the food, how was the CSAA bootcamp?". üåù

I would, without further ado say, "it was amazing."

To think that the convener Dr. Sofiat, ensured women were attended to, nursing mothers (with great interests), working class ladies and even people without personal computers made it (thanks to NitHub for making that happen).

It was an inclusive experience that ensured you learnt something within the short duration we all spent. I know, right?

A close pal during the bootcamp would say UNILAG likes PR but... so far as we were properly accommodated during the CSAA event, wetin concern me and your intentions.

The hostel experience was nice with enough electricity and water to justify the reasons we left our homes for the provided accommodation. I don't know about everyone else but I opted for accommodation for several reasons. One of which is to avoid the everyday Lagos stress as I juggle between the bootcamp and my house; I know I won't learn enough. I also needed to connect with other learners, which won't be possible if I am stuck trying to rush home after each day. Electricity can be unfavourable in my area, so let's not go there.

### Next Steps

As CSA Academy 2022 has come to an end, couple of things and further steps are clear to me:

- To improve further my Python programming skills bearing in mind the tools introduced to me. I also got a glimpse of data structures and algorithms since my roomies were in that track. This is something I would also explore further especially the time and space complexity problem.
- I got a renewed energy to deep dive into my machine learning studies; with respect to the theoretical aspects of things. Why do you choose this model over that? How do you explain what your model is doing to a lay person? I believe that is the beginning to building and working with explainable machine learning models.
- Truly, getting out to meet people helps you understand others and most especially, you. I met wonderful people and connected with a few of them. People are going through different things. Everyone simply devices a way to cope with the challenges of growing up to become a meaningful human. No one's got it worse, you just have it in a different measure.
- Aside the seriousness, CSAA has set a very high standard for other bootcamps I would be attending in the future. They understood and showed that the comfort of a learner is as important as the actual learning.
- But then, we have every little opportunity to influence people within our sphere. I plan to do that henceforth.

P.S: "Love and legacy are the sacrifices we make for progress."
