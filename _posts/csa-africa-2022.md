I attended [CSA Africa 2022](twitter.com/csa_africa), hosted by [So](twitter.com/) at [NitHub, UNILAG](twitter.com/nithub) and this is what I learnt.

There was lot of promises made to participants that I was so eager to attend. Free lunch, accomodation and three weeks of constant drills in python, data structures, machine learning and IoT. That sounds cumbersome but the experience was worth it. 

### Why was I there?

There is something I always believed about having enough information to get you ahead. And the need to connect with people going your way (on the same journey as you). CSA Africa was an avenue for me to explore programming beyond the confines of me and online tutorials. It was a means for me to learn and connect with people (beginners and experienced alike) in the tech space, meet amazing roomies I make friends out of and another I found a tech co-founder out of -- just kidding.

Well, I met people who were good at what they do. Those whom were in other walks of life but understand the use of programming in their future ambitions. I also met people who think far into the future and need help grabbing that future by its horn.

#### Week 1 experience.

Hi Stephen, twas wonderful having you speak of recursion and memonics. During our first class on recursion I recalled my very first task at work which involved a deeply nested json dictionary. I found it difficult untangling it and although a friend helped with some parts of it, I realised recursion/memonics is best suited to such problems.
