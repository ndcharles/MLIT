Hey, I read your story and I feel your pains. I understand you hate your job but then you don't want to quit, or you can't quit; whichever suits your reason. Probably because you have bills waiting to be paid, you're afraid that you won't be able to get another well paid job or even, you are scared that you don't have what it takes to get a job elsewhere.

While I understand your viewpoint, because I have been there, I also noticed that this is a career confusion. 

I don't know if you ever loved what you do or that you feel unappreciated, ... or a few other circunstance came up which led to this felling of disgust in your heart about your once beloved job. 

I used to nurture same feeling. In fact, the feeling of such contempt often leads me to leaving my job and that's how I left all my jobs.

I left my first job because I felt like I was underutilised, that I can be more. I once wrote a heartfelt piece on my constant feeling like a fraud. I left my second job because I felt like I wasn't doing enough. I was learning a lot on my own but I wasn't practising a lot of that. There was no mentor above to give me cahllenging thoughts. Now the feeling has crept in, I want to fight it this time and channe the feeling to another route. Something entirely creative and not something out of anger and contempt.

At the end of this, I will share with you a acreer confusion checklist. It will help you figure out what went wrong, how to subdue it and how best to chaccel your energy.

First, why are you angry at your job? Why the urge to quit?

{peace over money. mental health. etc}
what exactly makes your job miserable?

Now, what can we do do about it?


Something general, how to not be miserable at work

This is an experiment I have challenged myself to give a try everyday for the next 1 month and I believe that it would impact on my mood, focus, and overall productivity. What have I got to lose? Nothing. As I continue with this, it would strengthen me to start writing here and on my how-to blog.
