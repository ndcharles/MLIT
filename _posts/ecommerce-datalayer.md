One of the most common mistakes in product analytics are due to human error (not tools). These errors can be in the form of misaligned or incorrect tracking setup, insufficient knowledge of product analytics, poor definition of terms and the non-involvement of key stakeholders.

When the right people are not involved or terms are not accurately defined, it can lead to diverse views on what metrics mean and which to track. If then the implementation is done with insufficient knowledge, metrics can also be setup wrongly. This entire situation leads to incorrect data been generated by the analytics tools and then wrong conclusions afterwards.

The dataLayer created here is an extension of the [product analytics article]({{site.baseutl}}/cxl-product-analytics-how-data-build-products-customers-need) I wrote earlier.

## Components of data collection
There are several methods to collect data from a website for analytics purposes. It can be site-wide or element-specific. 

## What is a dataLayer?
DataLayer is a way to store semantic metadata based on users, sessions and events. We use it to give others an easy way of accessing information on the website.

It is a javaScript object/array with \[key: value] pairs in either a flat or nested notation.

Cons of dataLayers
- The major flaw with the dataLayer usage is that it requires developer effort to create and maintain. As the website changes, the dataLayer also needs to change with it. So, if you are a small business or DIY enthusiast with little budget, you have to take the easy and more affordable route.

## DataLayer Specification Template
First, let's recall the rules to creating a dataLayer specs document:
- It should be tool agnostic. That is, not created after a specific tool.
- It should be able to serve a generic use case
- It should follow a consistent naming convention

> Of course, there are exceptions to the above rules.

Notwithstanding, here are the key points in a list style for easy digestion.

### Summary 
In a nutshell, being a manager in times like this can be stressful considering the amount of technologies coming out in their flock. A tour through product hunt willtell you there are a lot of tools to drown in.
