## Good and Bad Algorithms

No algorithm is inherently good or bad. We can only have an algorithm suitable for a specific kind of task. In machine learning, there are more than one way to solve a particular problem. Example, to build a regression model, we can code by ourself, use linear regression, ridge or lasso, or even go afrther into deep learning. 

The question then becomes, "how do we selct which algorithm to use for a particular problem" since there are a lot to choose from.

This was the first of my questions when I got introduced to the data science space. To solve this problem, let's look at one characteristic of algorithm -- efficiency.

To consider an algorithm as efficient, it must have the following properties:

1. The algorithm should efficiently use the resources available to the system.
2. The computational time (time taken to generate an output) should be as less as possible.
3. The memory used by the algorithm should also be as less as possible. 

## Algorithm Efficiency

The efficiency of an algorithm is mainly defined by two factors i.e. space and time. A good algorithm is one that is taking less time and less space, but this is not possible all the time. There is a trade-off between time and space. If you want to reduce the time, then space might increase. Similarly, if you want to reduce the space, then the time may increase. So, you have to compromise with either space or time. 
Let's learn more about space and time complexity of algorithms.

Space Complexity of an algorithm is the total space used or needed by the algorithm for it to work.
