Add image within post: ![My helpful screenshot](/assets/screenshot.jpg)

Embed video within post using HTML: <p><iframe style="width:100%;" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Cniqsc9QfDo?rel=0&amp;showinfo=0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>


Linking to PDF directly: [get the PDF](/assets/mydoc.pdf) 
for external resource, replace the relative url to external url.


If you want to get really fancy, you can even add syntax highlighting using Rouge.


+ **bold**
+ __italicize__
+ ~~strike through~~
+ ==highlight==
+ \*escaped characters\*

Another way to insert links in markdown is using reference lists. You might want to use this style of linking to cite reference material in a Wikipedia-style. All of the links are listed at the end of the document, so you can maintain full separation between content and its source or reference.
