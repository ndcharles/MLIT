If you have been following recent developments in all aspects f life you will agree when you hear the World Economic Forum estimate that by 2030, 77% of jobs will require digital skills.

Life used to be fun [or so we thought] but yet limited us to just our immediate environment and some few distant neighbourhoods. We used to chat on WhatsApp and Facebook and believe that is all there is toa globally connected world. We even wake up every morning, take ourbath and rush off to work or school with the belief that that's the best way to handle life.

The COVID-19 exposed a lot of loopholes to how we approached life. Come to think of it, we know people work remotely, we know of people who learn online. All these while it seemed like a mystery. After COVID-19, all we thought we knew about work changed. More tools started emerging, working styles improved, oranisations adjusted to being remote-friendly. In the midst of these came the problem of hiring the right talent from across the world. Someone who knows what to do, can work efficiently in a remote setting and as well reliable to deliver when due. 

Now that getting remote work is easier than ever, why is it still difficult for young people especially in Africa to get these jobs?

> A lack of exposure to digital tools and digital ambition, makes many people ill-prepared for the jobs of the future.
