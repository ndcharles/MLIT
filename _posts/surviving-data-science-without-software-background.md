When I started data science with my pals, the popular advice is usually, "you don't need to know how to code to make it". Well, it was enough push to get us started. I am now a data scientist.

After several months of learning, doing train_test_split, I can confidently tell you that, to survive in data, you must learn what software developers do. Nobody told me this, even now but my daily struggle in interviews tells me so.

Here are my go to resources as I venture to learn software development practices. I mean, it can be boring sometimes, especially when you don't know where or when to apply something, but just learn it. Someday it will come handy.

### Concepts I have been looking at
- [Data structures in Python]()
- [Time and space complexity in programming]()
- [Function in programming - Python]()
- [Working with JSON in Python]()

### Books I have read and reading
- [The springer workbook]()
- [Self-taught programmer by Cory Althoff]()

### Materials I am eyeing
- [Learning Python by Mark Lutz]()
- [Programming Python by Mark Lutz]()
