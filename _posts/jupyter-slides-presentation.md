During our last few days at [CSA Africa 2022]() we had to create presentations for our projects. Some groups did it using jupyter slides (which didn't turn out as expected).

Today, as part of my Udacity program I got full exposure to the [jupyter nbconvert addon](). This is something huge with a lot of infinite possibilites. Now, I have decided to explore it further and see how easy it would be replacing PowerPoint with Jupyter for all my analysis and presentation needs.
