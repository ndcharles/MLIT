What I am about to tell you is a personal experience. Our mileage might differ, but from my experience, I can tell why Konga is behind Jumia and why it will continue staying so.

I did a draft of this post immediately after my [product analytics programme with CXL](). On 27th September, I stormed Konga after seeing this beautiful and cheap Saisho blender. I always wanted a blender. I once saw the Nima version but reviews insist it is small. So I needed something bigger that a lady can also use. That was when  stumbled on the Saisho blender whic went for about 6000-sth.

I had a bad experience earlier at Konga where I logged in but couldn't select a pick-off location. I kept getting errors. Now, haven seen the Nima blender and the Saisho blender at Konga, I decided to look for it on Jumia. They were there but costlier. Now this cost advantage is something Konga can us to ver-power Jumia. I don't know how they get products that are always cheaper; probably it is their surcharge from whlesalers that make it cheaper.

My Jumia exprince was seamlss as usual. But then, the price margin was too much between both platforms. Going back to Konga, I insisted on getting it from there. And that was where the frustration started.

1. The Facebook login is broken. Google login worked fine.
2. I created an account the proper way. Phone number verified and KongaPay verification done. Oya, login to Konga, I am seeing email or password error. Were you expecting me to reset the password I created just now? 
3. Contact customer care that morning, I was faced with a form to fill my details (I hate those). I went the WhatsApp way, the bot was as dumb as ever. After several back and forth, I ended up dropping my query. No one contacted me for over 24 hours.
4. I gave up on Konga and even lost the jinja I had earlier about shopping for the blender and other items.


What I think of Konga vs Jumia?
Jumia is fully ready to go online. konga on the other hand is trying very hard to integrate ecommerce into their workflow.
